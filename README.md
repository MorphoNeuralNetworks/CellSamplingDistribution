# CellSamplingDistribution
## Description
CellSpatialDistribution (CSD) tool is a point pattern analysis (PPA) framework to study the geometrical patterns of soma positioning in whole brain datasets.

The potential applications of this tool might include i) the geometrical characterization of soma positioning of different cell subtypes, ii) the detection of mispositioning of the soma originated during the course of neurodevelopment pathologies or iii) the precise location of a neuronal death based on abnormal nearest neighbor distances.

Currently, the tools is in beta version (the code requires to be revised, updated and cleaned for readability and usability) and we are planning to refine and expand this analysis framework.

### Overview
The tool  takes the soma locations and computes the Delaunay triangulation to extract several geometrical parameters relative to the nearest neighboring points (such as the distances, angles, and other geometrical metrics) to characterize the spatial distribution (geometrical structure) that cell subtypes follows to sampling the volumetrics space of the brain.
